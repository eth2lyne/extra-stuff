This is just a little page of scripts and alternative things that I made for fun and learnings sake.

None of the code posted on this page will ever be obfuscated, everything is open source and you are welcome to learn.
If you take any code directly from here any form of credits would be appreciated

If there are any issues with any of the items on this page leave an issue and I'll fix it at the earliest convenience.

If you have any questions, email me at deer@tutanota.de
